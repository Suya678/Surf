## 🌟 Inspiration
HomeSurf was created to address the limitations of traditional emergency housing, which is often too slow or rigid to meet sudden needs for temporary shelter.  
We realized that critical gaps in safety nets leave vulnerable individuals without safe options when institutional resources are unavailable.  

HomeSurf leverages *community generosity* — connecting those who can help with those who need immediate, short-term housing.
